# Facebook Realtime Lead Ads Demo

A demo for retrieving realtime leads from Facebook lead ads.

To make our demo applications can run as stand alone applications without additional web servers, we've built them based on micro web frameworks as follows:

* Java - based on [Javalin](https://github.com/tipsy/javalin)
* Node.js (JavaScript) - based on [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
* PHP - vanilla PHP with built-in web server
* Python - based on [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask)
* Ruby - based on [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra)

Note: We've simplified the demo applications to make them concise for a crash-course workshop and intentionally ignored handling some edge cases.
